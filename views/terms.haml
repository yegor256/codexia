  Each karma point earned is worth $1 (one US dollar) and
  can instantly be cashed-out via
  %a{href: 'https://wts.zold.io'} WTS
  to ZLD currency, which can be instantly converted to Bitcoins.
  You can withdraw everything that is above 100 points and
  was earner earlier than two days ago.

%p
  We are interested only in GitHub-hosted projects, which are
  1) not yet super popular,
  2) not yet sponsored by any large enterprise,
  3) larger than 5K lines of code, and
  4) may become market leaders if we help.
  Projects, which are not software products will be deleted.

%p
  We are interested in detailed reviews, which emphasize
  pros and cons of projects, from a professional subjective
  point of view of a user. A review may be deleted, if it is either
  1) too short, 2) too obvious, 3) copied from somewhere,
  or 4) too offensive.
